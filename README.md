## A Quackified Volafile Download script

@szero deserves all credit for the creation of this script, which is also heavily dependent on the beautifully written python volafile API he has written. It's creation was merely filling in the blanks that he provided, nothing could have been accomplished without his kind and sincere contribution.  

1. Python volapi is required.

2. Simply use:
```shell
python $SCRIPT_NAME $ROOM-NAME
```

3. This script barely scratches the surface of all the features provided by the Volafile API.
